Venus
=====

Venus is easy-to-use gamestate library with smooth transitions between states to make games feel better, as direct switch doesn't look and feel good.

Setup
-----

* Call venus.registerEvents() in love.load() to override love's callbacks. What it does is basically turning (love.callback) into (love.callback + venus.callback).

* Call venus.timer.update(dt) in love.update(dt). HUMP.Timer (by vrld) is used for tweens in transitions.

* Default transition animation is "fade". You can change the transition animation by changing venus.currentFx to the animation you want. (ex: "slide") 


Callbacks
---------

Venus has all the callbacks that LÃ–VE has (draw, update, etc) with all their arguments (like dt in update).
In addition to these, there are additional callbacks:

* init: Called once. Load and initialize stuff here.
* enter: Called each time you enter state.
* leave: Called each time you leave state.

Important note
--------------

Do NOT initialize anything in enter. Initialize/load everything in "init". 
The reason: Before switching to a state and starting animation, state is initialized.
This is done in order to load or initialize everything (images, text...) needed for drawing when playing animation.
"enter" is called when the animation stops and you finally enter the state.

Example:

main.lua:

```lua
venus = require "lib.venus"
require "states.tutorial"

function love.load()
    venus.registerEvents()
    venus.switch(tutorial)
end

function love.update(dt)
    venus.timer.update(dt)
end
```

    

State (tutorial.lua) file:
(Note: State table itself does not have to be in a separate file. This is done for easier developement)

```lua
tutorial = {} -- create state

function tutorial:init() -- ran only once
    -- notice that NOTHING is initialized in "enter" callback

    tutorial.text = [[
    Map:
    WASD/Mouse - Move camera
    Mouse wheel - Zoom in/out
      
    ESC - Menu
    Tab - Character Screen
      
    Battle:
    Space - Attack 
    Hotkey (or click) - Skill
    ]]
    
    tutorial.btn = GenericButton(4, "Start >>", function() Gamestate.switch(game) end)
end

function tutorial:enter() -- ran every time you enter state
    print("Entered tutorial state")
end
  
function tutorial:update(dt)
    tutorial.btn:update()
end
  
function tutorial:draw()
    tutorial.btn:draw()
    love.graphics.printf(tutorial.text, 0, 100, the.screen.width, "center")
end
  
function tutorial:mousereleased(x,y,button)
    tutorial.btn:mousereleased(x,y,button)
end

function tutorial:leave() -- ran each time you leave the state
    print("Left tutorial state!")
end
```
